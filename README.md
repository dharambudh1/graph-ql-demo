# GraphQL Demo

## Information
GraphQL allows clients to request only the specific data they need in a single query, minimizing over-fetching, while REST relies on fixed endpoints, often leading to over-fetching or under-fetching of data through multiple requests. GraphQL offers more flexibility and efficient data retrieval.

## Scenarios
Choosing between GraphQL and REST depends on the specific requirements of your project. GraphQL is often favored when flexibility in data fetching, reduced over-fetching, and a single endpoint are critical, while REST might be simpler for smaller, less complex projects.
